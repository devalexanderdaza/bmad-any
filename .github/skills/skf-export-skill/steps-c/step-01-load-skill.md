# Step 1: Load Skill

## STEP GOAL:

To load the target skill's artifacts, validate they meet agentskills.io spec compliance, parse export flags, and confirm with the user before proceeding to packaging.

## Rules

- Focus only on loading, validating, and confirming the skill — this is read-only
- Do not write any output files yet (packaging starts in Step 02)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Parse Export Arguments

"**Starting skill export...**"

Determine the skill(s) to export and any flags:

**Skill Path Discovery (version-aware — see `knowledge/version-paths.md`):**
- If user provided one or more skill names or paths as arguments, use that list directly
- If `--all` was passed, build the list from every skill in `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json.exports` whose `active_version` entry is not `status: "deprecated"` (deprecated skills are excluded from all exports — see step-04 §4b)
- If no explicit skill and no `--all`, discover available skills using the export manifest:
  1. Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` — list skill names from `exports`
  2. For each skill group directory in `{skills_output_folder}/`, check for `{skill_group}/active/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
  3. If neither manifest nor `active` symlink yields results, fall back to flat path: `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- If multiple skills are found, present the list and accept either a single selection or a comma-/space-separated multi-selection (e.g. `1, 2, 3` or `all`)
- If no skills found, halt: "No skills found in {skills_output_folder}/. Run create-skill first."

Store the resolved selection as `skill_batch` — a list of one or more skill names. `len(skill_batch) > 1` activates multi-skill mode (see §1c below).

**Flag Parsing:**
- `--all` flag: Check if provided. When true and no explicit skill list was given, `skill_batch` is the full non-deprecated manifest set (see above).
- `--context-file` flag: Check if explicitly provided (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, or AGENTS.md). Replaces the old `--platform` flag.
- `--dry-run` flag: Check if provided. Default: `false`

**Context File Resolution:**

If `--context-file` is explicitly provided, use that single context file as the sole target. Determine the skill root from the first configured IDE that maps to that context file (or `.agents/skills/` for AGENTS.md if no matching IDE is configured). If other IDEs are configured in config.yaml, emit a note: "**Note:** Exporting to {context-file} only. config.yaml also lists: {other-ides}. Run without `--context-file` to export to all configured IDEs."

If `--context-file` is NOT provided, read the `ides` list from config.yaml and map each IDE to its context file and skill root using the "IDE → Context File Mapping" table in `skf-export-skill/assets/managed-section-format.md`. Every IDE the installer offers has an explicit mapping — no silent skips.

For each IDE in `config.yaml.ides`:

1. Look up its `context_file` and `skill_root` from the canonical mapping table
2. If the IDE is not in the table, default to AGENTS.md / `.agents/skills/` and warn: "Unknown IDE '{value}' in config.yaml — defaulting to AGENTS.md with `.agents/skills/`"

**Deduplication:** Group by `context_file`. When multiple IDE entries map to the same context file (e.g. both `codex` and `cline` map to AGENTS.md), deduplicate so each context file appears in `target_context_files` only once. Use the **first configured IDE's** `skill_root` for that context file. Report the deduplication: "Multiple IDEs target AGENTS.md — using {first-ide}'s skill root (`{skill_root}`). Each IDE's skills are installed to its own directory."

**Missing-key handling:** If the `ides` key is absent from config.yaml (older installation or manually edited file), treat it as an empty list.

- If mapping produces one or more context files (after dedup), store as `target_context_files` list — each entry has `{context_file, skill_root}`
- If mapping produces zero entries (empty ides list and no recognized entries), fall back to `[{context_file: "AGENTS.md", skill_root: ".agents/skills/"}]` with note: "No IDEs configured in config.yaml — defaulting to AGENTS.md with `.agents/skills/`."

"**Skill(s):** {skill-batch-list} ({N} total)
**Context file(s):** {context-file-list} (skill root: {skill-root-list})
**Dry Run:** {yes/no}"

### 1b. Detect Snippet Root Prefix Mismatch

**Skip entirely if `snippet_skill_root_override` is already set in `config.yaml`** — the authoring-repo escape hatch is already configured and any on-disk prefix that matches it is ground truth (see `assets/managed-section-format.md` override rules).

Otherwise, probe existing snippets to catch the authoring-repo case (skills live under a single shared directory like `skills/` that does not match any per-IDE `skill_root`) before step-04 silently rewrites their root paths:

1. Collect candidate snippet paths:
   - Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` if it exists. For each skill in `exports` with a resolvable `active_version`, add `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/{active_version}/{skill-name}/context-snippet.md`
   - Also include the current skill's snippet if present (resolved via manifest / `active` symlink / flat path per `knowledge/version-paths.md`)
2. For each snippet that exists on disk, read the first line and parse the `root:` value. Strip the trailing `{skill-name}/` to extract the prefix (e.g. `skills/`, `.claude/skills/`)
3. Collect unique prefixes into `observed_prefixes`
4. Compare against `target_context_files[0].skill_root` (the first entry's IDE-mapped skill root — used as reference since step-03 §2.7 picks this same entry for snippet generation when no override is set)

**If `observed_prefixes` contains any value that does not match the reference `skill_root`:**

Emit a single warning (once, not per snippet) and present resolution options before proceeding:

"**Snippet root prefix mismatch detected.**
Existing snippets use: `{observed_prefixes}`
IDE-mapped skill_root:  `{target_context_files[0].skill_root}`

This usually means you are in an authoring repo where skills live under a single shared directory. Options:
- **(a) Set override** — add `snippet_skill_root_override: {observed_prefix}` to `config.yaml`. Snippets keep their on-disk prefix; the managed section references the real location.
- **(b) Proceed with IDE mapping** — step-04 will rewrite every snippet's root path to the IDE's skill_root. Use this only if the IDE's skill directory actually contains the skill files.
- **(c) Cancel** — abort export and investigate.

If multiple distinct prefixes were observed, the snippets disagree with each other — investigate before choosing (a)."

In `{headless_mode}`, default to (b) and log the observed prefix(es) so the mismatch is visible in run logs. In interactive mode, wait for user choice before continuing to section 2.

**If all observed prefixes match the reference `skill_root` (or no existing snippets were found):** Proceed silently.

### 1c. Multi-skill Mode (when `len(skill_batch) > 1`)

When multiple skills are being exported in a single run (via `--all`, multi-selection at the discovery menu, or an explicit multi-argument invocation), the workflow does NOT loop the full step-01→step-07 sequence once per skill. Instead, it partitions work across steps to avoid repeated gates and redundant batch work:

| Step | Behavior in multi-skill mode |
|------|------------------------------|
| step-01 §2–5 | **Iterate per skill** — load, validate, read metadata, and check the test report for every skill in `skill_batch`. Collect per-skill results. |
| step-01 §6 | **Single gate** — present one consolidated summary table (one row per skill) and a single [C] gate for the whole batch. |
| step-02 | **Iterate per skill** — validate each skill's package structure and collect per-skill readiness. |
| step-03 | **Iterate per skill** — regenerate each skill's `context-snippet.md` independently (each skill has its own prior-gotchas carry-forward state). |
| step-04 | **Batch once** — §3b orphan detection, §4 skill-index rebuild, §5 managed-section assembly, and §6–9 diff + write all execute once for the entire batch. The exported skill set in §4b already enumerates every skill in the manifest — it does not need per-skill iteration. §9b adds/updates a manifest entry per skill in `skill_batch` (not just the last one), then writes the manifest once. |
| step-05 | **Iterate per skill** — compute token counts per skill, then present one aggregate report. |
| step-06 | **One batch summary + one result contract** — the files-written table lists every skill; the result contract JSON covers the whole run, and `outputs` enumerates every context-snippet + target context file touched. |
| step-07 | **Runs once** — health check is per-workflow-run, not per-skill. |

**Halt semantics in batch mode:** if any single skill fails validation in §2 (required-file or metadata-field failure), halt the entire batch before §5 — do not partially export. Report which skill failed and why.

**Single-skill mode (`len(skill_batch) == 1`)** preserves the legacy behavior: every section below operates on the one skill without iteration.

### 2. Load and Validate Skill Artifacts

Resolve the skill's versioned path before loading artifacts:

1. Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` and look up `{skill-name}` in `exports` to get `active_version`
2. If found: resolve to `{skill_package}` = `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/{active_version}/{skill-name}/`
3. If not in manifest: check for `active` symlink at `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/active` — resolve to `{skill_group}/active/{skill-name}/`
4. If neither: fall back to flat path `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/`. If SKILL.md exists at the flat path, auto-migrate per `knowledge/version-paths.md` migration rules
5. Store the resolved path as `{resolved_skill_package}` for all subsequent artifact loading

Load all files from `{resolved_skill_package}`:

**Required Files (hard halt if missing):**
- `SKILL.md` — The main skill document
- `metadata.json` — Machine-readable skill metadata

**Optional Files (note presence):**
- `references/` — Progressive disclosure directory
- `context-snippet.md` — Existing snippet (will be regenerated)

**Validation Checks:**
1. `SKILL.md` exists and is non-empty
2. `metadata.json` exists and is valid JSON
3. `metadata.json` contains required fields: `name`, `version`, `skill_type`, `source_authority`, `exports`, `generation_date`, `confidence_tier`
4. `metadata.json.exports` is a non-empty array (warn if empty — graceful handling)

**If any required validation fails:**
"**Export cannot proceed.** Missing or invalid: {list failures}
Run create-skill to generate a complete skill first."

### 3. Read Skill Metadata

Extract from `metadata.json`:
- `name` — Skill display name
- `skill_type` — `single` or `stack`
- `source_authority` — `official`, `internal`, or `community`
- `exports` — Array of exported functions/types
- `generation_date` — When the skill was last generated
- `confidence_tier` — Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep

**For stack skills, also extract:**
- `components` — Array of dependencies with versions
- `integrations` — Array of co-import patterns

### 4. Check Forge Configuration

Load `{sidecar_path}/preferences.yaml` (if exists):
- Check `passive_context` setting
- If `passive_context: false` — note that steps 03-04 (snippet + context update) will be skipped

### 4b. Check Test Report (Quality Gate)

Search for a test report at `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/{active_version}/test-report-{skill_name}.md` (i.e., `{forge_version}/test-report-{skill_name}.md`). If not found at the versioned path, fall back to `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/test-report-{skill_name}.md`:

**If test report found:**
- Read frontmatter `testResult` and `score`
- If `testResult: fail`: warn: "**Warning:** This skill failed its last test (score: {score}%). Consider running `@Ferris TS` and addressing gaps before export."
- If `testResult: pass`: note: "Last test: **PASS** ({score}%)"

**If no test report found:**
- Warn: "**Note:** No test report found for this skill. Consider running `@Ferris TS` before export to verify completeness."

Continue to step 5 regardless — this is advisory, not blocking.

### 5. Present Skill Summary

**Single-skill mode:**

"**Skill loaded and validated.**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | {name} |
| **Type** | {skill_type} |
| **Authority** | {source_authority} |
| **Confidence** | {confidence_tier} |
| **Exports** | {count} functions/types |
| **Generated** | {generation_date} |
| **References** | {count files or 'none'} |

**Export Configuration:**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Context File(s)** | {context-file-list} (skill root: {skill-root-list}) |
| **Explicit --context-file** | {yes (user-specified) / no (from config.yaml)} |
| **Dry Run** | {yes/no} |
| **Passive Context** | {enabled/disabled} |

**Top Exports:**
{list top 5 exports from metadata}

**Is this the correct skill to export?**"

**Multi-skill mode** (`len(skill_batch) > 1`):

"**{N} skills loaded and validated.**

| # | Name | Type | Authority | Tier | Exports | Test |
|---|------|------|-----------|------|---------|------|
| 1 | {name-1} | {type} | {authority} | {tier} | {count} | {pass/fail/none} |
| 2 | {name-2} | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| N | {name-N} | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Export Configuration (applies to all):**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Context File(s)** | {context-file-list} (skill root: {skill-root-list}) |
| **Explicit --context-file** | {yes / no (from config.yaml)} |
| **Dry Run** | {yes/no} |
| **Passive Context** | {enabled/disabled} |

**Are these the correct skills to export?**"

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select:** [C] Continue to packaging" (multi-skill mode: the single [C] gate covers the whole batch)

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Proceed with loaded skill data, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other: help user respond, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#6-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- **GATE [default: C]** — If `{headless_mode}`: auto-proceed with [C] Continue, log: "headless: auto-continue past skill confirmation"
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user confirms the correct skill is loaded by selecting 'C' will you load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute packaging.
