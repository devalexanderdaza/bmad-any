# Step 3: Extract

## STEP GOAL:

To extract all public exports, function signatures, type definitions, and co-import patterns from the source code using tier-appropriate tools, building a complete extraction inventory with confidence-tiered provenance citations.

## Rules

- Focus only on extracting exports, signatures, types from source code — do not compile SKILL.md
- Do not write any output files — extraction stays in context
- Every extracted item must have a provenance citation: `[AST:{file}:L{line}]` or `[SRC:{file}:L{line}]`

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Load Extraction Patterns

Load `{extractionPatternsData}` completely. Identify the strategy for the current forge tier.

### 2. Apply Scope Filters

From the brief, apply scope and pattern filters:

- `scope.type` — determines what to extract (e.g., `full-library`, `specific-modules`, `public-api`, `component-library`, `reference-app`, `docs-only`). Use `reference-app` when the source is a whole app and the skill's value is wiring patterns rather than public exports (embedded-sidecar reference apps, CLI-demo repos, integration-pattern demonstrators). `reference-app` triggers the compile-assembly overrides in `{compileAssemblyRules}` that replace "Key API Summary" with a "Pattern Surface" section and make `stats.exports_documented` semantics pattern-oriented. Do NOT pick `full-library` for reference apps — downstream assembly will remap wiring onto export slots, producing fuzzy counts and an awkward SKILL.md.
- `scope.include` — file globs to include
- `scope.exclude` — file globs to exclude

Build the filtered file list from the source tree resolved in step-01. Record the result: "**Filtered file count: {N} files in scope**" — this count is the input to the AST Extraction Protocol decision tree in the extraction patterns data file.

### 2a. Discovered Authoritative Files Protocol

**Skip this section entirely if `source_type: "docs-only"`** — there is no source tree to scan.

Before resolving source access for extraction, scan the source tree for **authoritative AI documentation files** that the brief's scope filters excluded. Project authors increasingly add files specifically written to steer AI assistants (`llms.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.), and these files often contain the **canonical** install command, quick-start, or architecture summary — information that nowhere else in the source tree provides. A brief authored from a scan of `src/**` will frequently exclude these files without the author realizing they exist.

This protocol detects such files, prompts the user, and records the decision in the brief so future runs (re-create, update, audit) honor it.

**Heuristic scan list (case-insensitive basename match, any directory depth):**

- `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `COPILOT.md`
- `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`

**Procedure:**

1. **Walk the source tree** resolved in step-01 (NOT the filtered file list from §2 — we want files the brief excluded too). Match file basenames against the heuristic list case-insensitively.

2. **Diff against filtered list.** For each match, check whether the path is already present in §2's filtered file list:
   - **Already in scope (matched by `scope.include`):** **remove the path from the filtered file list** and add it directly to `promoted_docs[]` with `{path, heuristic, size_bytes, line_count, content_hash}`. No prompt — the user or a prior amendment already said it belongs in scope, but authoritative docs must never reach §4 code extraction. This is both the "already promoted from a prior run" case and the "user manually added to scope.include" case.
   - **Excluded by brief patterns:** this is a **candidate** for the prompt at step 5.

3. **Check existing amendments.** Before prompting, consult `brief.scope.amendments[]` (see `src/skf-brief-skill/assets/skill-brief-schema.md` for the schema). If any amendment entry has `path == candidate.path`, the decision is already recorded:
   - `action: "promoted"` → the file should already be in `scope.include` (amendments are write-through). No prompt. **Still populate `promoted_docs[]`** for this path — compute its content hash and add a `{path, heuristic, size_bytes, line_count, content_hash}` entry so step-05 §6 writes the `file_entries[]` row. This is the deterministic replay path for re-runs.
   - `action: "skipped"` → user previously declined. No prompt. Do not add to `promoted_docs[]`. Move on.

4. **Load preview.** For each unresolved candidate, read the first 20 lines of the file. Record the line count and file size in bytes.

5. **Prompt.** Present each candidate to the user:

   ```
   **Discovered authoritative file excluded by brief scope**

   Path: {relative_path_from_source_root}
   Size: {line_count} lines, {bytes} bytes
   Matched heuristic: {basename}
   Excluded by pattern: {matching_exclude_pattern or "not matched by any scope.include"}

   First 20 lines:
   {inline preview}

   This file is typically authored for AI assistants and may contain canonical usage information not present elsewhere in the source. How should extraction handle it?

   [P] Promote — include in this extraction run AND amend brief for future runs
   [S] Skip    — honor the brief exclusion AND record skip in amendments (no re-prompt)
   [U] Update  — halt this run and return to skf-brief-skill to refine scope
   ```

6. **Headless mode (`{headless_mode}` is true):** auto-select `[S] Skip` for every candidate. Record amendment entries with `action: "skipped"` and `reason: "headless: no user to prompt"`. A non-interactive run must never silently promote files into scope — the decision requires a human.

7. **Apply decision:**

   - **[P] Promote:**
     1. **Do NOT add the path to the filtered file list from §2.** Authoritative documentation files are not code — they must not go through the AST extraction pipeline in §4, which would silently produce no exports (ghost entries). Instead, add the path to a new in-context list `promoted_docs[]` with `{path, heuristic, size_bytes, line_count, content_hash}`. Compute the SHA-256 content hash of the file now.
     2. Append to `brief.scope.include`: add the exact `candidate.path` as a literal glob (no wildcards — the amendment targets this specific file). This write ensures that a re-run of `skf-create-skill` against the amended brief sees the path in scope and skips re-prompting.
     3. Append to `brief.scope.amendments[]` a new entry with `action: "promoted"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided one-sentence reason or auto-generated "authoritative AI docs — matched heuristic {basename}"}`, `heuristic: {basename}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-create-skill"`.
     4. **Write the amended brief back to disk immediately** at `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml`. Immediate write (not deferred to step-07) ensures a crashed run still leaves the amendment recorded. Preserve all other brief fields and formatting. **Use atomic write + backup:** before writing, copy the original brief to `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml.bak` (overwriting any prior `.bak` — the most recent pre-amendment snapshot is the useful one). Then pipe the amended YAML through the shared atomic writer so a crash mid-write cannot corrupt the brief:

        ```bash
        # 1. Backup
        cp {forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml \
           {forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml.bak

        # 2. Atomic write (stdin → tmp → fsync → rename)
        cat <<'AMENDED_YAML' | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write \
            --target {forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml
        {amended brief YAML}
        AMENDED_YAML
        ```

        The helper stages into `{brief}.skf-tmp`, fsyncs, then `os.replace()`s — readers never see a half-written brief.
     5. Display: "**Promoted `{path}`** — tracked as documentation file, amendment recorded."

   - **[S] Skip:**
     1. Do NOT modify `scope.include` or `scope.exclude`.
     2. Append to `brief.scope.amendments[]` a new entry with `action: "skipped"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided reason or auto-generated "user declined promotion at create-skill §2a"}`, `heuristic: {basename}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-create-skill"`.
     3. **Write the amended brief back to disk** so future runs do not re-prompt. Use the same backup-then-atomic-write pattern as the [P] Promote path (copy to `skill-brief.yaml.bak` first, then pipe through `skf-atomic-write.py write --target {brief_path}`).
     4. Display: "**Skipped `{path}`** — decision recorded in amendments."

   - **[U] Update:**
     1. Halt the workflow immediately.
     2. Display: "**Halting create-skill.** Re-run `skf-brief-skill` to refine the scope filters for `{skill_name}`, then re-run `skf-create-skill`. Decisions for previously prompted candidates were already persisted to the brief; the current candidate was not written."
     3. Exit with status `halted-for-brief-refinement`.

8. **Summary.** After all candidates are resolved (or none were found), display a one-line summary:

   - `"Authoritative files scan: {N} candidates, {P} promoted, {S} skipped, {A} pre-decided from amendments."`
   - If N = 0: `"Authoritative files scan: no candidates."`

**Record for evidence report:** `authoritative_files_scan: {candidates: N, promoted: P, skipped: S, pre_decided: A, decisions: [{path, action, heuristic, reason}]}` — step-07 includes this in `evidence-report.md`.

**How promoted docs reach the provenance map:**

Promoted docs do NOT flow through §4 code extraction. Instead:

1. §2a populates the in-context `promoted_docs[]` list with content hashes.
2. **Step-05 §6** (provenance-map assembly) reads `promoted_docs[]` and emits one `file_entries[]` entry per promoted doc with `file_type: "doc"`, `extraction_method: "promoted-authoritative"`, `confidence: "T1-low"`, and the pre-computed `content_hash`.
3. **Step-07 §2** does NOT copy doc files into the skill package (unlike scripts and assets). The source file remains at its original path; only the provenance map tracks it. Future audit and update workflows compare against this tracking entry via content hash — no file copy is required because the intent is drift detection on the *source*, not bundling documentation into the skill output.

**Re-running `skf-create-skill`** reads the amended brief. Files with `action: "promoted"` amendments already appear in `scope.include`, but §2a still runs — it detects the file is in scope AND has an existing amendment, and takes the "pre-decided" silent path. The `promoted_docs[]` list is rebuilt on each run by scanning amendments with `action: "promoted"` (this is the deterministic replay path).

**Downstream workflow consumption** (zero code changes required):

- **`skf-update-skill`** reads `provenance-map.json`. Promoted docs appear as `file_entries[]` entries. Update-skill Category D (script/asset file changes) iterates `file_entries` and compares content hashes — this works identically for `file_type: "doc"` entries, giving drift detection for free.
- **`skf-audit-skill`** (after the bounded re-index fix) scans files from `provenance-map.json`. The re-index builds its list from `entries[].source_file ∪ file_entries[].source_file`, so promoted doc paths are naturally included in the audit scan.

The brief is the single source of truth for authored scope intent. The provenance map is the single source of truth for extracted state. `scope.amendments[]` is the bridge that records when those two intentionally diverged. `promoted_docs[]` is the in-memory handoff from §2a to step-05 §6; it is not persisted — the persisted form is the `file_entries[]` list in provenance-map.json.

### 2b. Resolve Source Access

**If `source_type: "docs-only"`:** skip §2b entirely — there is no source to resolve. Proceed directly to §2c (component library delegation, which is itself skipped for docs-only) and then §3 (Check for Docs-Only Mode). Tag resolution, remote/workspace cloning, source-commit capture, version reconciliation, and deferred CCC discovery all require a source tree and have nothing to do in docs-only mode.

Load `{sourceResolutionData}` completely. Follow these protocols in order:
1. **Tag Resolution** — run the explicit variant when `brief.target_version` is set, or the implicit variant when only `brief.version` is set (Forge/Deep remote sources only). This sets `source_ref` before any clone happens. Quick tier remote sources skip this.
2. **Remote Source Resolution** — workspace or ephemeral clone, cleanup (Forge/Deep tiers).
3. **Source Commit Capture** — all tiers.
4. **Version Reconciliation** — all tiers.

This ensures source code is accessible regardless of which extraction path is taken below (standard, component-library, or docs-only).

**Deferred CCC Discovery (Forge+ and Deep — remote sources only):**

If ALL of these conditions are true:
- `tools.ccc` is true in forge-tier.yaml
- `{ccc_discovery}` is empty (step-02b deferred because source was remote)
- `remote_clone_path` is set (source resolution succeeded for a remote URL)
- Tier is Forge+ or Deep

Then run CCC indexing and discovery on the resolved clone (workspace or ephemeral):

1. **Check existing index:** If `{remote_clone_path}/.cocoindex_code/` already exists (workspace repo with a persisted CCC index), skip steps 2-3 and proceed directly to step 4 using `ccc search --refresh` instead of plain `ccc search`. The `--refresh` flag tells CCC to re-index if files have changed since the last index, then search. This is the fast path for workspace repos that have been indexed before. **Note:** If `--refresh` is not supported by the installed ccc version, omit the flag — ccc will use the existing index.

2. **Initialize index (first time only):** Run `cd {remote_clone_path} && ccc init`. If init fails, set `{ccc_discovery: []}` and continue — this is not an error.

   **Apply standard exclusions:** After `ccc init`, apply generic build/dependency exclusions to `{remote_clone_path}/.cocoindex_code/settings.yml`. These are standard artifact patterns, NOT SKF-specific paths (the workspace checkout is a source repo, not an SKF project):

   ```
   node_modules/, dist/, build/, .git/, vendor/, __pycache__/, .cache/, .next/, .nuxt/, target/, out/, .venv/, .tox/
   ```

   Read `settings.yml`, append any patterns not already present to the `exclude_patterns` array, write back. **Reuse check:** if an existing `.cocoindex_code/settings.yml` was already present (workspace hit), read its `exclude_patterns` first and diff against the standard-exclusion list above. If ANY standard entry is missing from the existing list, append only the missing entries (preserving any user-added patterns) AND force a re-index by running `ccc index --force` (or the equivalent rebuild flag). If every standard entry is already present, skip the write and skip the forced re-index — the existing index is valid. Record `ccc_exclusions_augmented: {count}` in context for the evidence report.

   **Note:** Brief-specific `include_patterns` and `exclude_patterns` are NOT written to `settings.yml`. The CCC index is general-purpose — it indexes everything (minus standard artifacts). Brief-specific filtering happens at search result time, not index time. This allows a single workspace CCC index to serve multiple briefs with different scope filters.

3. **Index the clone:** Run `cd {remote_clone_path} && ccc index` with an extended timeout or in background mode. Indexing can take several minutes on large codebases (1000+ files). Use `ccc status` to verify completion — check that `Chunks` and `Files` counts are non-zero. If indexing fails, set `{ccc_discovery: []}` and continue — this is not an error.

4. **Construct semantic query:** Build from brief data: `"{brief.name} {brief.scope}"`. Truncate to 80 characters — keep the full skill name and trim `brief.scope` from the end. If `brief.scope` is very short (< 10 chars), append terms from `brief.description` to fill the remaining space.

5. **Execute search:** Run `ccc_bridge.search(query, remote_clone_path, top_k=20)`:
   - **If existing index was found (step 1):** Use `cd {remote_clone_path} && ccc search --refresh --limit 20 "{query}"` — this re-indexes if files changed, then searches. If `--refresh` is not supported by the installed ccc version, omit the flag — ccc will use the existing index.
   - **Otherwise:** Use `cd {remote_clone_path} && ccc search --limit 20 "{query}"` after indexing in step 3.
   - **Tool resolution:** Use `/ccc` skill search (Claude Code), ccc MCP server (Cursor), or CLI. Note: `ccc search` operates on the index in the current working directory. See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

6. **Store results:** If search succeeds, store as `{ccc_discovery: [{file, score, snippet}]}`. Display: "**CCC semantic discovery: {N} relevant regions identified across {M} unique files.**"

   If `remote_clone_type == "workspace"` and an existing index was reused, append: "(reused workspace index)"

7. **On failure:** Set `{ccc_discovery: []}`. Display: "CCC discovery unavailable — proceeding with standard extraction." Do NOT halt.

**CCC Discovery Integration (Forge+ and Deep with ccc only):**

If `{ccc_discovery}` is in context and non-empty (populated by step-02b or deferred discovery above):
- Sort the filtered file list by CCC relevance score: files appearing in `{ccc_discovery}` results move to the front of the extraction queue, sorted by their relevance score descending
- Files NOT in CCC results remain in the queue after ranked files — they are not excluded, only deprioritized
- Display: "**CCC discovery: {N} files pre-ranked by semantic relevance** — extraction will prioritize these first."

If `{ccc_discovery}` is empty or not in context: proceed with existing file ordering (no change to current behavior).

### 2c. Component Library Delegation

**Skip this section if `source_type` is `"docs-only"` — docs-only skills do not use component extraction.**

**If `scope.type: "component-library"` in the brief:**

"**Component library detected.** Delegating to specialized extraction strategy for registry-first, props-focused extraction."

Load and execute `{componentExtractionStepFile}` completely. When that step completes, it returns control here. Resume at section 5 (Build Extraction Inventory) with the enriched extraction data and `component_catalog[]` from the component extraction step.

**Otherwise:** Continue with standard extraction below.

### 3. Check for Docs-Only Mode

**If `source_type: "docs-only"` in the brief data:**

"**Docs-only mode:** No source code to extract. Documentation content will be fetched from `doc_urls` in step-03c."

Build an empty extraction inventory with zero exports. **Set `top_exports = []` explicitly in context** — downstream steps (notably §3b targeted searches and step-04 enrichment fan-out) must see an empty list rather than an undefined/missing field so they can short-circuit deterministically. Set `extraction_mode: "docs-only"` in context. Auto-proceed through Gate 2 (section 6) — display the empty inventory and note that T3 content will be produced by the doc-fetcher step.

**If `source_type: "source"` (default):** Continue with extraction below.

### 4. Execute Tier-Dependent Extraction

Source resolution, version reconciliation, and CCC discovery were completed in section 2b. Proceed with the tier-specific extraction strategy below.

**Quick Tier (No AST tools):**

1. Use `gh_bridge.list_tree(owner, repo, branch)` to map source structure (if remote)
2. Identify entry points: index files, main exports, public modules
3. Use `gh_bridge.read_file(owner, repo, path)` to read each entry point
4. Extract from source text: exported function names, parameter lists, return types
5. Infer types from JSDoc, docstrings, type annotations
6. Confidence: All results T1-low — `[SRC:{file}:L{line}]`

**Tool resolution for gh_bridge:** Use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{branch}?recursive=1` for list_tree, `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` for read_file. If source is local, use direct file listing/reading instead. See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

**Forge/Forge+/Deep Tier (AST available):**

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Before executing AST extraction, load the **AST Extraction Protocol** section from `{extractionPatternsData}`. Follow the decision tree based on the file count from step-01's file tree. This determines whether to use the MCP tool, scoped YAML rules, or CLI streaming. Never use `ast-grep --json` (without `=stream`) — it loads the entire result set into memory and will fail on large codebases. Always use the explicit `run` subcommand with streaming: `ast-grep run -p '{pattern}' --json=stream`.

1. Detect language from brief or file extensions
2. Follow the AST Extraction Protocol decision tree from `{extractionPatternsData}`:
   - ≤100 files: use `find_code()` MCP tool with `max_results` and `output_format="text"`
   - ≤500 files: use `find_code_by_rule()` MCP tool with scoped YAML rules
   - >500 files: use CLI `--json=stream` with line-by-line streaming Python — **CRITICAL:** inject the brief's `scope.exclude` patterns into the Python filter's `EXCLUDES` list (use `[]` if absent) so excluded files are discarded before consuming `head -N` slots (see template in extraction patterns data)
3. For each export: extract function name, full signature, parameter types, return type, line number
4. Use `ast_bridge.detect_co_imports(path, libraries[])` to find integration points
5. Build extraction rules YAML data for reproducibility
6. Confidence: All results T1 — `[AST:{file}:L{line}]`

**Tool resolution for ast_bridge:** Use ast-grep MCP tools (`mcp__ast-grep__find_code`, `mcp__ast-grep__find_code_by_rule`) as specified in the AST Extraction Protocol above, or `ast-grep` CLI. For `detect_co_imports`, use `find_code_by_rule` with a co-import YAML rule scoped to the libraries list. See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

**If AST tool is unavailable at Forge/Deep tier** (see `{tierDegradationRulesData}` for full rules):

⚠️ **Warn the user explicitly:** "AST tools are unavailable — extraction will use source reading (T1-low). Run [SF] Setup Forge to detect and configure AST tools for T1 confidence."

Degrade to Quick tier extraction. Note the degradation reason in context for the evidence report.

**For each file — handle failures gracefully:**

- If a file cannot be read: log warning, skip file, continue with remaining files
- If AST parsing fails on a file: fall back to source reading for that file, continue

**Re-export tracing (Forge/Deep only):** After the initial AST scan, check for unresolved public exports from entry points (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`). Follow the **Re-Export Tracing** protocol in `{extractionPatternsTracingData}` to resolve them to their definition files.

### 4b. Validate Exports Against Package Entry Point

After extraction, validate the collected exports against the package's actual public API surface:

- **Python:** Read `{source_root}/__init__.py` — extract imports to build the public export list. Compare against AST results:
  - In AST but not entry point → mark as internal (exclude from `metadata.json` exports)
  - In entry point but not AST → flag as extraction gap (trace via re-export protocol)
- **TypeScript/JS:** Read `index.ts`/`index.js` — same comparison logic.
- **Rust:** Read `lib.rs` — extract `pub use` items. Same logic. **Go:** Scan for exported (capitalized) identifiers.

Use the entry point as the authoritative source for `metadata.json`'s `exports[]` array.

**If entry point is missing or unreadable:** Skip validation with a warning.

### 4c. Detect and Inventory Scripts/Assets

**Default resolution:** If `scripts_intent` is absent from the brief, treat as `"detect"` (auto-detection). If `assets_intent` is absent, treat as `"detect"`. Only an explicit `"none"` value disables detection.

**If `scripts_intent` is `"none"` AND `assets_intent` is `"none"`:** Skip this section entirely. **If only one is `"none"`:** Skip that category only, proceed with the other.

After export extraction, scan the source for scripts and assets using the detection patterns in `{extractionPatternsTracingData}`:

1. Scan source tree for directories/files matching detection heuristics (scripts/, bin/, tools/, cli/ for scripts; assets/, templates/, schemas/, configs/, examples/ for assets)
2. For each candidate: verify existence, check size (flag >500 lines), exclude binaries, compute SHA-256 hash
3. Extract purpose from header comments, shebang, README references, or schema fields. Record: file_path, purpose, source_path, language/type, content_hash, confidence (T1-low)

Add results to `scripts_inventory[]` and `assets_inventory[]` alongside the existing export inventory.

### 5. Build Extraction Inventory

Compile all extracted data into a structured inventory:

**Per-export entry:**
- Function/type name
- Full signature with types
- Parameters (name, type, required/optional)
- Return type
- Source file and line number
- Provenance citation (`[AST:...]` or `[SRC:...]`)
- Confidence tier (T1 or T1-low)

**Aggregate counts:**
- Total files scanned
- Total exports found
- Exports by type (functions, types/interfaces, constants)
- Confidence breakdown (T1 count, T1-low count)
- `top_exports[]` — sorted list of the top 10-20 public API function names by prominence (import frequency or documentation position). This named field is consumed by step-03b for targeted temporal fetching and cache fingerprinting.

**Script/asset counts (when detected):**
- `scripts_found`: count of scripts detected
- `assets_found`: count of assets detected

**Co-import patterns (Forge/Deep only):**
- Libraries commonly imported alongside extracted exports
- Integration point suggestions

### 6. Present Extraction Summary (Gate 2)

**Docs-only note:** If `docs_only_mode` is active (`extraction_mode: "docs-only"`), display a brief note explaining that T3 content will be added by the doc-fetcher step (step-03c), then auto-proceed past this gate. Example: "Docs-only mode: extraction inventory is empty. Documentation content will be fetched from `doc_urls` in step-03c. Auto-proceeding."

Display the extraction findings for user confirmation:

"**Extraction complete.**

**Files scanned:** {file_count}
**Exports found:** {export_count} ({function_count} functions, {type_count} types, {constant_count} constants)
**Confidence:** {t1_count} T1 (AST-verified), {t1_low_count} T1-low (source reading)
**Tier used:** {tier}
**Co-import patterns:** {pattern_count} detected
{if scripts_found > 0: **Scripts detected:** {scripts_found}}
{if assets_found > 0: **Assets detected:** {assets_found}}

**Top exports:**
{list top 10 exports with signatures}

{warnings if any files skipped or degraded}

Review the extraction summary above. Select an option to continue."

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Extraction Summary — Select an Option:** [C] Continue to compilation"

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- IF docs-only mode (`extraction_mode: "docs-only"`): Auto-proceed immediately to `{nextStepFile}` — no user interaction required
- OTHERWISE: ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting the extraction summary
- **GATE [default: C]** — If `{headless_mode}`: auto-proceed with [C] Continue, log: "headless: auto-approve extraction summary"
- This is Gate 2 — user must confirm before compilation proceeds (except docs-only mode)
- User may ask questions about the extraction results before continuing

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Confirm extraction inventory is complete. Immediately load, read entire file, then execute `{nextStepFile}`
- IF Any other comments or queries: answer questions about the extraction results, then redisplay the menu

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the extraction inventory is built with provenance citations and the user has confirmed the extraction summary will you proceed to load `{nextStepFile}` for temporal context fetching.
