# Step 7: Generate Output Files

## STEP GOAL:

Write all deliverable and workspace artifact files to their target directories.

## Rules

- Write all output files in correct directory structure — do not modify compiled content from Step 06
- Create directory structure before writing files
- Report each file written with path and size

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Resolve Paths and Stage Target Directory

Resolve `{version}` from the primary library version or default to `1.0.0` (see S11 in "Primary library" note below). The final artifact paths are:

```
{skill_group}                          # {skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/
{skill_package}                        # {skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/{version}/{project_name}-stack/
├── references/
│   └── integrations/
{forge_version}                        # {forge_data_folder}/{project_name}-stack/{version}/
```

Where the skill name is `{project_name}-stack` and `{version}` is the semver version (with build metadata stripped per `knowledge/version-paths.md`).

**Primary library definition (S11):** In code-mode, the primary library is the dependency with the highest import count from step-03; its `version` (from the manifest) becomes `{primary_library_version}`. In compose-mode, use the highest semver across constituent skill `metadata.json` files. If neither is available, fall back to `1.0.0`.

**Pre-flight: group-dir type check (S3):** If `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/` already exists, probe `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/active/{project_name}-stack/metadata.json`. If that metadata exists and `skill_type != "stack"`, HALT with:

"**Cannot proceed.** `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/` exists but is not a stack skill (`skill_type={found_type}`). Rename the existing directory or choose a different `project_name` to avoid collision."

Do NOT proceed to staging or commit.

**Atomic write strategy (C2 / B5):** All artifact writes for `{skill_package}` MUST stage into a temp directory first, then commit atomically via `skf-atomic-write.py commit-dir`. The active symlink flip only happens AFTER the commit succeeds.

Create the staging directory:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} stage-dir --target {skill_package}
```

After this call, writes land in `{skill_package}.skf-tmp/` (referred to below as `{skill_staging}`). Create the required subdirectories inside the staging dir:

```bash
mkdir -p {skill_staging}/references/integrations
```

Also create the forge workspace directory directly (these are workspace artifacts, not deliverables — they do not need stage-dir / commit-dir):

```bash
mkdir -p {forge_version}
```

**Rollback contract:** If ANY write in sections 2–7 below fails, immediately run:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} commit-dir --rollback --target {skill_package}
```

Then abort with a structured error contract (see B7): purge any `{forge_version}/*-tmp` staging artifacts, emit `{"status":"error","skill":"skf-create-stack-skill","stage":"step-07","reason":"<message>"}` on stderr, and halt the workflow.

### 2. Stage SKILL.md

Write the approved `skill_content` from step 06 to `{skill_staging}/SKILL.md` (regular write — the whole staging dir will be atomically committed later).

### 3. Stage Per-Library Reference Files

For each confirmed library, write `{skill_staging}/references/{library_name}.md`:

Load structure from `{stackSkillTemplate}` references section:
- Library name, version from manifest (**in compose-mode**: version from source skill `metadata.json`)
- Import count and file count (**in compose-mode**: export count from source skill metadata)
- Key exports with signatures
- Usage patterns with file:line citations (**in compose-mode**: usage patterns from source skill SKILL.md)
- Confidence tier label

### 4. Stage Integration Pair Reference Files

For each detected integration pair, write `{skill_staging}/references/integrations/{libraryA}-{libraryB}.md`:

Load structure from `{stackSkillTemplate}` integrations section:
- Library pair and integration type
- Co-import file count
- Integration pattern description with file:line citations
- Usage convention
- Confidence tier label

**If no integrations detected:** Skip this section (no files to write).

### 5. Stage context-snippet.md

Write `{skill_staging}/context-snippet.md`:

Use the Vercel-aligned indexed format targeting **~80-120 tokens** (M2). Token estimation is heuristic — use `ceil(char_count / 4)` as the working approximation (the standard rule-of-thumb for English text in BPE-style tokenizers; precise counts differ per model). Compute against the rendered snippet body (excluding trailing newline).

```
[{project_name}-stack v{version — in code-mode: primary_library_version or 1.0.0; in compose-mode: highest version across constituent skill metadata.json files, or 1.0.0 if none}]|root: skills/{project_name}-stack/
|IMPORTANT: {project_name}-stack — read SKILL.md before writing integration code. Do NOT rely on training data.
|stack: {dep-1}@{v1}, {dep-2}@{v2}, {dep-3}@{v3}
|integrations: {pattern-1}, {pattern-2}
|gotchas: {1-2 most critical integration pitfalls}
```

**Overflow strategy (M2):** If the estimated token count exceeds **120 tokens**, trim in this fixed order until under budget:

1. **Drop the `gotchas` line first.** Pitfalls live in SKILL.md and references; the snippet's job is discovery, not full warning surface.
2. **Strip versions from the `stack` line** (`{dep-1}, {dep-2}` instead of `{dep-1}@{v1}`). Versions are recoverable from `metadata.json`.
3. **Truncate the `stack` list to the top 8 dependencies by import count** (or by export count in compose-mode), appending `, ...+{N} more`.
4. **Truncate the `integrations` list to the top 5 by file count**, appending `, ...+{N} more`.

If the snippet is still over budget after step 4, log a warning to workflow_warnings (see Workflow Rules in SKILL.md) — do not block the write. The `IMPORTANT:` line is mandatory and never trimmed.

**Underflow note:** Snippets below ~80 tokens are acceptable (small stacks naturally produce short snippets). The lower bound is informational, not enforced.

### 6. Stage metadata.json

Write `{skill_staging}/metadata.json`:

Populate all fields from the metadata.json schema defined in `{stackSkillTemplate}`.

**Tier fields:**
- `forge_tier` — the run tier (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep) resolved in step-01.
- `confidence_tier` — the dominant T-code from `confidence_distribution`. Pick the tier with the highest count; resolve ties toward the weaker tier (T1-low > T1, T2 > T1-low, T3 > T2) so the reported value never overstates confidence. When `confidence_distribution` is empty (no libraries extracted), emit `"T1-low"` as the conservative default.

```json
{
  "skill_type": "stack",
  "name": "{project_name}-stack",
  "version": "{primary_library_version or 1.0.0}",
  "generation_date": "{current_date}",
  "forge_tier": "{Quick|Forge|Forge+|Deep — the tier under which this run executed}",
  "confidence_tier": "{T1|T1-low|T2|T3 — dominant T-code from confidence_distribution below}",
  "spec_version": "1.3",
  "source_authority": "{official|community|internal — use the lowest authority among constituent skills}",
  "generated_by": "create-stack-skill",
  "exports": [],
  "library_count": N,
  "integration_count": N,
  "libraries": ["lib1", "lib2"],
  "integration_pairs": [["lib1", "lib2"]],
  "language": "{primary language or list of languages from constituent skills}",
  "ast_node_count": "{number or omit if no AST extraction performed}",
  "confidence_distribution": {"t1": N, "t1_low": N, "t2": N, "t3": N},
  "tool_versions": {
    "ast_grep": "{version or null}",
    "qmd": "{version or null}",
    "skf": "{skf_version}"
  },
  "stats": {
    "exports_documented": N,
    "exports_public_api": N,
    "exports_internal": N,
    "exports_total": N,
    "public_api_coverage": 0.0,
    "total_coverage": 0.0,
    "scripts_count": N,
    "assets_count": N
  },
  "dependencies": [],
  "compatibility": "{semver-range}"
}
```

### 7. Write Forge Data Artifacts (Workspace)

Write workspace artifacts directly to `{forge_version}` (these are workspace-only, not part of the skill package — no staging required). Each individual file MUST be written via `skf-atomic-write.py write` to avoid partial-write corruption:

```bash
<json-content> | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {forge_version}/provenance-map.json
<md-content>   | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {forge_version}/evidence-report.md
```

If any workspace write fails, invoke the rollback contract from §1.

**provenance-map.json:**

**In code-mode:**
```json
{
  "provenance_version": "2.0",
  "skill_name": "{project_name}-stack",
  "skill_type": "stack",
  "source_repo": ["{repo_url_1}", "{repo_url_2}"],
  "source_commit": {"{repo_1}": "{hash_1}", "{repo_2}": "{hash_2}"},
  "generated_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "entries": [
    {
      "export_name": "{name}",
      "export_type": "{type}",
      "source_library": "{library-name}",
      "params": [],
      "return_type": "{type}",
      "source_file": "{file}",
      "source_line": 0,
      "confidence": "T1|T1-low|T2",
      "extraction_method": "ast_bridge|source_reading|qmd_bridge",
      "signature_source": "T1|T2|T3"
    }
  ],
  "integrations": [
    {
      "libraries": ["{libA}", "{libB}"],
      "pattern_type": "{type}",
      "detection_method": "co-import grep",
      "co_import_files": [{"file": "{path}", "line": 0}],
      "confidence": "T1|T2"
    }
  ]
}
```

**In compose-mode:**
```json
{
  "provenance_version": "2.0",
  "skill_name": "{project_name}-stack",
  "skill_type": "stack",
  "source_repo": null,
  "source_commit": null,
  "source_ref": null,
  "generated_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "entries": [
    {
      "export_name": "{name}",
      "export_type": "{type}",
      "source_library": "{library-name}",
      "params": [],
      "return_type": "{type}",
      "source_file": "{from constituent skill}",
      "source_line": 0,
      "confidence": "T1|T1-low|T2",
      "extraction_method": "compose-from-skill",
      "signature_source": "T1|T2|T3"
    }
  ],
  "integrations": [
    {
      "libraries": ["{libA}", "{libB}"],
      "pattern_type": "{type}",
      "detection_method": "architecture_co_mention|inferred_from_shared_domain",
      "co_import_files": [],
      "confidence": "T2|T3"
    }
  ],
  "constituents": [
    {
      "skill_name": "{constituent-skill-name}",
      "skill_path": "skills/{skill-dir}/",
      "version": "{version from constituent metadata.json}",
      "composed_at": "{ISO-8601}",
      "metadata_hash": "sha256:{hash of constituent metadata.json}"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Per-export entries use the same schema as single skills (see `skill-sections.md`), with `source_library` identifying the originating library. In compose-mode, `constituents[]` enables audit to detect constituent drift via metadata hash comparison. **Use the `metadata_hash` value already stored in workflow state during step-02 (S13) — do NOT re-read and re-hash at step-07 time. The stored hash captures the state as it was at manifest-detection time, which is the correct provenance anchor.**

**evidence-report.md:**
- Extraction summary per library
- Integration detection results per pair
- Warnings and failures encountered
- Confidence tier distribution

### 8. Commit Staging Directory

After all staged writes in sections 2–6 completed successfully, atomically swap the staging dir into place:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} commit-dir --target {skill_package}
```

The helper moves any existing `{skill_package}` aside to a `.skf-rollback-<pid>` dir before the swap. On failure the helper restores the prior target and exits non-zero — in that case invoke the rollback contract from §1 and HALT.

### 9. Flip Active Symlink

ONLY AFTER `commit-dir` succeeds, flip the `{skill_group}/active` symlink to point at `{version}`:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} flip-link --link {skill_group}/active --target {version}
```

The helper holds an flock on `{skill_group}/active.skf-lock` and refuses to replace a non-symlink at `{skill_group}/active` — this guards against accidentally overwriting a real directory (ECH BLOCKER 6/B6). After the flip, `{skill_group}/active/{project_name}-stack/` resolves to the just-committed skill package.

If `flip-link` fails, emit a warning (the committed package is still valid), note the symlink-flip failure in the evidence report, and continue.

### 10. Display Write Summary

"**Output files written.**

**Deliverables** ({skill_package}):
- SKILL.md ({line_count} lines)
- context-snippet.md ({token_estimate} tokens)
- metadata.json
- references/ -- {lib_count} library files
- references/integrations/ -- {pair_count} integration files

**Workspace** ({forge_version}):
- provenance-map.json
- evidence-report.md

**Symlink:** {skill_group}/active -> {version}

**Total files written:** {total_count}

**Proceeding to validation...**"

### 11. Auto-Proceed to Next Step

Load, read the full file and then execute `{nextStepFile}`.
