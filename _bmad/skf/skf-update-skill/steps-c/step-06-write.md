# Step 6: Write Updated Files

## STEP GOAL:

Verify the merged SKILL.md and stack reference files that step-04 section 6b wrote to disk, then write the derived artifacts (metadata.json, provenance-map.json, evidence-report.md, context-snippet.md, and the active symlink).

## Rules

- Focus only on verifying merged files and writing derived artifacts — merge content was already written in step-04
- Do not modify merged SKILL.md content — any mismatch detected during verification triggers HALT, not repair
- Do not skip provenance map update — critical for future audits
- HALT immediately on verification failure before writing any derived artifact — a partial-write skill package is worse than an unchanged one

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 0. Description Guard Protocol

**Used by:** §7 (`skill-check check --fix` and `skill-check split-body --write`), and any future tool invocation that may modify SKILL.md's frontmatter on disk.

External validators occasionally rewrite the frontmatter `description` field — `skill-check --fix` may replace it with a generic or truncated version, and `split-body` may touch it during mechanical restructuring. The merged description written to disk in step-04 is **authoritative**: it reflects the final merge of the prior skill's description (with any author edits preserved) and fresh re-extraction results. Losing it to a tool's well-meaning rewrite breaks discovery quality and — if the prior skill was compiled from a sanitized description (step-05 §2a) — can re-introduce angle-bracket tokens that then fail tessl on the next run.

To prevent this, any tool invocation in §7 that may touch SKILL.md must run inside the following four-phase guard:

1. **Capture.** Before invoking the tool, read `{skill_package}/SKILL.md` frontmatter and snapshot the exact `description` value into a local variable (e.g., `guarded_description`). Capture the in-context copy as well.
2. **Execute.** Run the tool as specified in its section.
3. **Verify.** After the tool completes, re-read the on-disk SKILL.md and compare its frontmatter `description` against `guarded_description`. Normalize whitespace for comparison (trim leading/trailing whitespace, collapse internal runs) but do not ignore content differences.
4. **Restore on divergence.** If the post-tool description differs from `guarded_description` in any way other than whitespace normalization, write `guarded_description` back to the on-disk SKILL.md frontmatter and update the in-context copy to match. Record `description_guard_restored: true` with the tool name in context for the evidence report.

**What counts as divergence:**

- The description was replaced (different content).
- The description was truncated (suffix missing).
- Angle-bracket tokens were re-introduced (should never happen if the prior skill was correctly sanitized, but protect anyway).
- The field was deleted entirely (extreme tool behavior).

**What does NOT count as divergence:** whitespace-only differences (trailing newline, trimmed spaces) — treat as equivalent.

**Why this lives in update-skill too:** the guard protocol was first introduced in `skf-create-skill/step-06-validate.md §0` to defend the freshly-compiled description. Update-skill runs the identical `skill-check check --fix` command against the merged skill package in §7, so it faces the same risk and needs the same defense. Keep the two §0 protocols functionally identical — if external tool behavior changes, update both workflows.

### 1. Verify SKILL.md Write

SKILL.md was written in step-04 section 6b. Verify the write landed intact before proceeding to any derived-artifact writes.

- Read `{skill_package}/SKILL.md` from disk
- Count `<!-- [MANUAL:*] -->` opening markers and compare against the [MANUAL] inventory captured in step-01
- Verify the resolved `{skill_package}` path matches the version directory step-04 wrote to (if the version changed, step-04 updated `{skill_package}` in context to point at the new path)
- If [MANUAL] count matches and path resolves: proceed to section 2
- **If [MANUAL] count does not match: HALT immediately.** Do not write `metadata.json`, `provenance-map.json`, or any other artifact — further writes would compound the inconsistency. Alert the user:

  "**[MANUAL] section count mismatch after write.** Expected {N} from step-01 inventory, found {M} on disk at `{skill_package}/SKILL.md`. The skill package is in an inconsistent state. Manual recovery required — restore the previous version from `{skill_group}/{previous_version}/` or fix the file in place, then re-run update-skill."

### 2. Write Updated metadata.json

Update `{skill_package}/metadata.json`:
- Update `version`: **if `update_mode == "gap-driven"`, do not bump — the skill is being repaired against the same source commit, so leave `version` unchanged and update only `generation_date` / `last_update` below.** This keeps metadata `version` consistent with the on-disk `{skill_package}` path, which step-04 §6b also leaves unchanged in gap-driven mode (see step-04 §6b's "If the source version detected during step-03 differs..." carve-out — in gap-driven mode no source version is detected, so step-04 writes into the existing version directory). Otherwise, if a source version was detected during re-extraction and differs from the current metadata version, use the source version; otherwise increment patch version
- Update `generation_date` timestamp to current ISO-8601 date
- Update `exports` array to reflect current export list
- Update `stats` from re-extraction results:
  - `exports_documented`: count of exports with documentation in the merged skill
  - `exports_public_api`: count of exports from public entry points (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`, or equivalent)
  - `exports_internal`: count of all other non-underscore-prefixed exports
  - `exports_total`: `exports_public_api` + `exports_internal`
  - `public_api_coverage`: `exports_documented / exports_public_api` (`null` if `exports_public_api` is 0)
  - `total_coverage`: `exports_documented / exports_total` (`null` if `exports_total` is 0)
- Update `confidence_distribution` from re-extraction results:
  - `confidence_distribution.t1`, `confidence_distribution.t1_low`, `confidence_distribution.t2`, `confidence_distribution.t3`: update counts from re-extraction results
  - `scripts_count`, `assets_count`: update from re-extraction results if scripts/assets changed
- For stack skills: update `library_count`, `integration_count` if changed

### 3. Write Updated provenance-map.json

Write to `{forge_version}/provenance-map.json`:

**If `no_reextraction == true` (gap-driven mode from step-03 section 0):**
Dispatch per-entry on the verification outcome recorded by step-03 — gap-driven runs produce a mix of `verified`, `moved`, `re-extracted`, and `unknown` outcomes, and each requires a different provenance-map write strategy:

- **`verified` exports**: no fresh extraction data exists — do NOT overwrite `confidence`, `extraction_method`, `ast_node_type`, `params[]`, `return_type`, `source_file`, or `source_line`. The provenance entry stays byte-identical.
- **`moved` exports**: update `source_line` (and `source_file` if different) to the new location recorded by the spot-check. Do not touch other fields.
- **`re-extracted` exports** (resolved via step-03 §0a's Targeted Re-Extraction Branch from `remediation_paths[]`): write a full entry — `source_file`, `source_line`, `confidence`, `extraction_method`, `ast_node_type`, `params[]`, `return_type` — from §0a's fresh AST extraction record. This is the only gap-driven outcome that produces normal-mode-quality provenance; do NOT fall through to the byte-identical preservation above.
- **`unknown` exports** (not in provenance map; no `source_citation`; `severity` is `Medium`, `Low`, or `Info`, OR `remediation_paths[]` was empty and §0a did not halt): add new entries with fields populated from step-04 merge output. `source_file`/`source_line` may be `null` here — leave these fields unset rather than writing stale values. **This path is only acceptable for `severity` in `Medium`, `Low`, or `Info`.** A Critical/High `unknown` reaching this branch indicates step-03 §0a was skipped or bypassed and is a workflow bug — step-03 §0a should have halted with status `halted-for-remediation-path` before step-06 ran. If you encounter one, halt with a pointer to §0a rather than writing null citations for a blocking gap.
- Skip the "For each export in the updated skill" bullets below — they apply only to normal re-extraction mode.

**For each export in the updated skill (normal mode only):**
- Update `export_name` if renamed
- Update `params[]` array if parameters changed (add, remove, or modify individual entries)
- Update `return_type` if changed
- Update `source_file` if moved
- Update `source_line` from fresh extraction
- Update `confidence` from extraction results
- Update `extraction_method` and `ast_node_type` if re-extracted with different tools

**For deleted exports:**
- Remove entry from provenance map

**For new exports:**
- Add new entry with full structured fields: `export_name`, `export_type`, `params[]`, `return_type`, `source_file`, `source_line`, `confidence`, `extraction_method`, `ast_node_type`

**For script/asset file changes (if `file_entries` exists):**
- MODIFIED_FILE: copy updated file to `scripts/` or `assets/`, update `content_hash` in `file_entries`
- DELETED_FILE: remove file from `scripts/` or `assets/`, remove entry from `file_entries`
- NEW_FILE: copy file to `scripts/` or `assets/`, add entry to `file_entries` with `file_name`, `file_type`, `source_file`, `confidence: "T1-low"`, `extraction_method: "file-copy"`, `content_hash`

**Add update operation metadata:**
```json
{
  "last_update": "{current_date}",
  "update_type": "{incremental if normal mode | full if degraded_mode}",
  "files_changed": {count},
  "exports_affected": {count},
  "confidence_tier": "{tier}",
  "manual_sections_preserved": {count}
}
```

### 4. Write Updated evidence-report.md

Append update operation section to `{forge_version}/evidence-report.md` (create the file with a standard header if it does not yet exist):

```markdown
## Update Operation — {current_date}

**Trigger:** {manual / audit-skill chain}
**Forge Tier:** {tier}
**Mode:** {normal / degraded}

### Changes Detected
- Files modified: {count}
- Files added: {count}
- Files deleted: {count}
- Exports affected: {total}

### Merge Results
- Exports updated: {count}
- Exports added: {count}
- Exports removed: {count}
- [MANUAL] sections preserved: {count}
- Conflicts resolved: {count}

### Validation Summary
- Spec compliance: {PASS/WARN/FAIL}
- [MANUAL] integrity: {PASS/WARN/FAIL}
- Confidence tiers: {PASS/WARN/FAIL}
- Provenance: {PASS/WARN/FAIL}

### Description Guard
- Restored: {true/false}
- Triggering tool: {tool_name or —}
- Original description preserved: {true/false}
- Notes: {one-sentence detail or —}

### Context Snippet
- Regenerated: {true/false}
- Triggers fired: {list or —}
- Notes: {one-sentence detail or —}
```

**Description Guard population** (used by §7 Post-Write Validation when the §0 protocol fires): fill all four fields from context when `description_guard_restored == true` (triggering tool, whether restore succeeded, what changed). When `Restored: false`, the other three fields are `—` — this is the clean-run expected state. Same field semantics and populator logic as create-skill step-06 §8.

**Context Snippet population** (used by §5 after the staleness check runs): §4 writes the sub-block with placeholders; §5 updates the on-disk evidence report in place after deciding whether to regenerate. Set `Regenerated: true` and populate `Triggers fired` with any combination of `headline-exports`, `version`, `gotchas` when at least one trigger fired. Set `Regenerated: false` and `Triggers fired: —` when none fired (the gap-driven / internals-only outcome). Always fill `Notes` with a one-sentence reason (e.g., `"Gap-driven repair — no snippet surface changed"`, `"Version bumped 0.1.0 → 0.2.0; headline exports re-ranked"`).

### 5. Verify Stack Skill Reference File Writes (Conditional) and Regenerate context-snippet.md

**ONLY if skill_type == "stack":**

Stack reference files were written in step-04 section 6b. Verify each affected reference file that the merge produced:

- Read each `references/{library}.md` back from disk
- Read each `references/integrations/{pair}.md` back from disk
- Verify per-file [MANUAL] section counts match the per-file inventory captured in step-01
- **If any verification fails: HALT** using the same recovery protocol as section 1 — do not regenerate `context-snippet.md` or write any further derived artifact

**For all skills (both single and stack) — regenerate `context-snippet.md` if stale:**

`context-snippet.md` is a `{skill_package}` deliverable that goes stale whenever **headline exports**, **version**, or **gotchas** change in this run. Regenerate it only when at least one of these triggers fired; otherwise skip — a skip is the correct outcome for gap-driven repairs and other runs that touch internals below the snippet's surface, where regenerating would produce byte-identical content.

**Staleness triggers:**

- **Headline exports changed** — the top-K exports surfaced in the snippet differ from the prior snippet (a `NEW_EXPORT` was promoted into a headline slot, or a `MODIFIED_EXPORT` changed the signature/shape of a surfaced export).
- **Version changed** — §2 bumped `version` (normal mode with detected source drift; never fires in gap-driven mode per §2's carve-out).
- **Gotchas changed** — new gotchas surfaced from this run's evidence that were not in the prior snippet, or a prior gotcha was invalidated and removed.

**Record the decision on the on-disk evidence report:** open `{forge_version}/evidence-report.md` (written by §4 with placeholder values in the `### Context Snippet` sub-block) and update that sub-block under the Update Operation section just written. Set `Regenerated: true|false`, fill `Triggers fired:` with the list of triggers that fired (or `—` when none), and write a one-sentence `Notes:` entry. See §4's "Context Snippet population" note for field semantics.

**If no trigger fired:** skip regeneration — do not touch `context-snippet.md` on disk. The snippet remains valid against the prior run's surface. Continue to §5b.

**If at least one trigger fired:** regenerate the snippet using the format from the matching template file:

- For single skills: `skf-create-skill/assets/skill-sections.md` (pipe-delimited indexed format)
- For stack skills: `skf-create-stack-skill/assets/stack-skill-template.md`

Use the **flat draft form** for the `root:` path in the draft snippet: `root: skills/{skill-name}/`. The per-IDE skill root (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/`, `.github/skills/` — see `skf-export-skill/assets/managed-section-format.md`) is applied later by `export-skill` step-03 when the skill is exported. Do not choose an IDE-specific prefix in update-skill — that is an export-time decision that depends on config.yaml.

Pull values for the regenerated snippet from the updated metadata.json (version, top exports), the merged SKILL.md (section anchors, inline summaries), and the evidence report (new gotchas). If gotchas cannot be derived from the updated evidence but the prior snippet has a `|gotchas:` line, carry forward the prior line with the `[CARRIED]` marker — see `skf-export-skill/steps-c/step-03-generate-snippet.md` for the carry-forward protocol (one-cycle limit).

Write the regenerated snippet to `{skill_package}/context-snippet.md`, preserving file permissions.

**If skill_type == "stack"**, also verify that the reference file updates from the first half of this section have been applied before writing the snippet so the stack snippet reflects the newest integration list.

### 5b. Update Active Symlink (If Version Changed)

If the version was incremented or changed in section 2 (metadata.json update):
- Create or update the `active` symlink at `{skill_group}/active` pointing to the new `{version}`
- If the symlink already exists, remove it first and recreate

```
{skill_group}/active -> {version}
```

If the version did not change, the existing symlink already points to the correct version -- no action needed.

### 6. Verify Derived Artifact Writes

SKILL.md was verified in section 1 and stack reference files in section 5 (both written by step-04 section 6b). This section verifies the artifacts this step wrote: `metadata.json`, `provenance-map.json`, `evidence-report.md`, `context-snippet.md`, and the `active` symlink from §5b.

For each derived artifact:
- Read back the file
- Confirm content matches expected output
- Report verification status

**Active symlink verification:** resolve `readlink({skill_group}/active)` and assert it equals the `version` just written to `metadata.json` in §2. This closes the §5b gap where a silent skip would otherwise leave the manifest and symlink divergent — the symlink is the fallback resolver for consumers that don't read the manifest (see `knowledge/version-paths.md` §Reading Workflows step 5), so a mismatch must fail the step, not warn. Applies in every mode — gap-driven runs do not bump `version`, but the symlink must still point to the current `version`, otherwise a prior partial run left it pointing elsewhere.

"**Write Verification:**

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| SKILL.md | {VERIFIED in section 1} |
| metadata.json | {VERIFIED/FAILED} |
| provenance-map.json | {VERIFIED/FAILED} |
| evidence-report.md | {VERIFIED/FAILED} |
| context-snippet.md | {VERIFIED/FAILED} |
| {skill_group}/active symlink | {VERIFIED/FAILED} (readlink → {resolved_version}, expected {version}) |
| {stack reference files...} | {VERIFIED in section 5} |

**On symlink FAILED:** HALT. Do not proceed to §7 post-write validation or §8 menu. Alert the user: "**Active symlink divergence.** `{skill_group}/active` resolves to `{resolved_version}` but `metadata.json` reports `version: {version}`. §5b did not apply. Re-point the symlink manually (`ln -sfn {version} {skill_group}/active`) or re-run update-skill, then re-verify." This matches the severity of the other four artifact checks — silent divergence here mis-routes any downstream consumer that uses the symlink fallback.

**All files written and verified.**"

### 7. Run Post-Write Validation (Deferred from Step 05)

External tool checks deferred from step-05 now run against the written files.

**Description Guard Protocol:** every invocation below that may modify SKILL.md (`skill-check check --fix` and any `split-body` write) must run inside the four-phase guard defined in §0. Capture `guarded_description` before each call, execute, verify against the post-tool description, and restore on divergence. Do not rely on per-call ad-hoc preservation logic — use the §0 protocol.

**If skill-check available:**

- Run: `npx skill-check check {skill_package} --fix --format json --no-security-scan` **inside the §0 guard**.
- **Context sync after --fix:** If `fixed[]` is non-empty (i.e., `--fix` modified files on disk), re-read the modified SKILL.md to update the in-context copy. This prevents silent divergence between the in-context SKILL.md and the on-disk version that step-07-report will reference. The §0 guard has already restored `description` if divergent; the re-read picks up any other fix-corrected content.
- If `body.max_lines` reported, prefer selective split — extract only the largest Tier 2 section(s) to `references/`, keeping Tier 1 inline (inline passive context achieves 100% task accuracy vs 79% for on-demand retrieval). **If falling back to `npx skill-check split-body {skill_package} --write`, run it inside the §0 guard** — split-body can also touch frontmatter. Verify anchors resolve after split.
- Run: `npx skill-check diff` if original version was preserved.
- Run: `npx skill-check check {skill_package} --format json` for security scan. (Read-only; guard not required.)

Record findings in the evidence report (section 4), including any `description_guard_restored` events recorded by the §0 protocol. These are advisory — do not block on warnings.

**If skill-check unavailable:** Skip with note — structural checks from step-05 are sufficient.

### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Proceeding to report...**"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- After all writes verified and post-write validation complete, immediately load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- This is an auto-proceed step with no user choices
- Proceed directly to report after verification

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN all files have been written and verified will you load {nextStepFile} to display the change report.
